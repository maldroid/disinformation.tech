# Claim ID: 00002

The following claim is repeated by some online blogs:

> **unexpected pop-ups can indicate a spyware infection**

The claim is considered: :x: **FALSE** :x:

## Why is it false?
There can be many reasons for unexpected pop-ups, ranging from software which tries to monetise its installations through pop-ups (this is called adware[^adware]) to fake pop-ups displayed in the browser to convince the user to perform some action[^fake]). However, the primary objective of spyware is to _covertly_ steal user data. Impacting user experience goes against that goal, so it's extremely unlikely that spyware would display pop-ups. This is especially true of state-sponsored spyware (e.g. Pegasus or FinSpy), which has no incentive to monetise the installation.
