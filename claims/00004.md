# Claim ID: 00004

The following claim is often repeated in analysis critical of forensic reports:

> **a name of a process similar to a legitimate process means it’s not malware**

The claim is considered: :x: **FALSE** :x:

## Why is it false?
Malware proceses frequently use a misspelling of a benign process name in order to masquarade its activities[^mitre]. This is particurarly true when it comes to Pegasus[^amnesty]. Just the fact that the process name or a file name is _similar, but not the same_ as a legitimate process name or file name does not make it benign.
